This repo holds some examples and exercises of automated user acceptance testing with Selenium. It also includes the dependencies and .xml file to create an extent report formatted into a html document.

I will be using IntelliJ Ultimate as my IDE. Link [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)

Since I am using `chromedriver.exe` if you use this project you will need Google Chrome installed. Link [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
